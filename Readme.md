## Project Overview

The Peddy Pet Adoption Platform is designed to connect animal lovers with adoptable pets.  
It fetches data from an API, displays categorized pets, and allows users to view detailed information, sort by price, and mark pets as liked or adopted — all with smooth UI interactions.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Category Filtering**  
   Browse pets by categories such as Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, and Birds.  
   Data is fetched dynamically from the API based on selected categories.

2. **Price-Based Sorting**  
   Sort pets by adoption price (ascending or descending) using ES6 array methods.

3. **Interactive Adoption Flow**  
   Users can like pets and adopt them with an animated confirmation.  
   Adopted pets are visually marked to show adoption status.

4. **Detailed Pet Modal View**  
   View complete pet details including breed, gender, age, birth date, and price in a popup modal.

5. **Fully Responsive Design**  
   Built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for smooth responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
